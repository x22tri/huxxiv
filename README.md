HUXXIV is a web application that tracks how Hungarian words will change in the next three centuries (hence the name HU-XXIV, as in "Hungarian"-"24").

This is a TypeScript project created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that uses React-Bootstrap for styling.

The project is in **pre-alpha**. Most functionalities are missing. The only word currently available is **kapcsos**.
